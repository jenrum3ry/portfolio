<p>In my first PM role, I spent three months building a feature I was absolutely certain would transform how our customers worked. I'd surveyed users, analyzed competitors, and created detailed specs. Leadership loved the vision. Engineering was excited about the technical challenge. We shipped on schedule.</p>

<p>Adoption was 12%.</p>

<p>I'd been so focused on being right (on having the answers, demonstrating conviction, showing leadership I knew what to build) that I'd optimized for confidence instead of truth. I learned the hard way that the PM's real job isn't knowing what to build. It's discovering what's worth building before you waste months building the wrong thing.</p>

<p>The best PMs I know aren't the ones who are right most often. They're the ones who figure out they're wrong the fastest.</p>

<h2>The Confidence Trap</h2>

<p>Product management has a dangerous cultural expectation: PMs are supposed to "have vision." We're expected to walk into roadmap meetings with conviction, defend our priorities with confidence, and project certainty even when we're operating with incomplete information.</p>

<p>This expectation isn't malicious. It comes from reasonable organizational needs. Stakeholders need to plan budgets. Engineering teams need clear direction. Sales needs to commit to customers. Everyone wants to believe that someone knows where we're going.</p>

<p>But here's the problem: confidence without evidence is just expensive guessing.</p>

<p>When PMs optimize for appearing certain rather than discovering truth, we create roadmaps that look impressive in presentations but crumble on contact with reality. We commit to building features that sound strategic but don't move outcomes. We defend decisions because we've already invested in them, not because they're still the right call.</p>

<p>The confidence trap is seductive because it feels like leadership. It's easier to present a polished roadmap and say "trust me" than to say "here's what we're betting on, and here's how we'll know if we're wrong." The former looks like vision. The latter looks like uncertainty.</p>

<p>But only one of them is actually strategic.</p>

<h2>What "Being Wrong Faster" Actually Means</h2>

<p>Being wrong faster isn't about being reckless or making poor decisions. It's about building systems that expose bad assumptions before they become expensive mistakes.</p>

<p>Here's what this looks like in practice:</p>

<p><strong>Small bets over big bets.</strong> Instead of committing to a six-month roadmap based on what you think will work, commit to validating specific assumptions over the next four weeks. Build the smallest thing that can test your hypothesis. If you're wrong, you've lost four weeks, not six months.</p>

<p><strong>Discovery before execution.</strong> This doesn't mean endless research that delays shipping. It means establishing lightweight, continuous touchpoints with customers that give you ongoing signal about whether you're heading in the right direction. Weekly customer conversations reveal wrong turns faster than quarterly research initiatives.</p>

<p><strong>Outcome focus over feature focus.</strong> When you frame roadmaps around outcomes ("increase adoption by 30%") instead of features ("build AI-powered recommendations"), you create space to pivot when you discover a better path to your goal. Features lock you in. Outcomes give you flexibility to be wrong about the how while staying focused on the what.</p>

<p><strong>Transparent decision-making.</strong> Document what you're betting on and why. Write down the assumptions that would need to be true for your plan to work. This makes it easier to recognize when reality contradicts your assumptions, and it prevents the sunk cost fallacy from keeping you committed to the wrong path.</p>

<p><strong>Building organizational memory of successful pivots.</strong> When you discover you're wrong and change course, don't hide it as a "scope change" or "shifting priorities." Call it what it is: you learned something important and adjusted. Then track whether that pivot worked. Over time, you build credibility that pivoting based on learning is strategic, not indecisive.</p>

<p>The core insight is that being wrong is inevitable. The market shifts, customers behave unpredictably, competitors move, technology evolves. You can't avoid being wrong. But you can absolutely control how quickly you discover it and how much you've invested before you figure it out.</p>

<h2>The Org Design Challenge</h2>

<p>Here's the hard part: most organizations aren't set up to reward being wrong faster. They're set up to punish being wrong at all.</p>

<p>Performance reviews celebrate shipped features, not validated assumptions. Roadmap presentations reward confidence, not honest uncertainty. Quarterly planning cycles lock teams into commitments before they have the data to know if those commitments make sense.</p>

<p>This creates a perverse incentive: PMs learn to present certainty even when they're guessing, because ambiguity looks like weakness. We commit to features we're not sure will work because changing our minds later looks like poor planning. We delay customer conversations until after we've already decided what to build because we're afraid of what we might learn.</p>

<p>Changing this dynamic requires deliberate organizational design:</p>

<p><strong>Reserve capacity for learning in your plans.</strong> Don't present roadmaps that assume perfect information. Explicitly allocate 15-20% of your timeline for course corrections based on what you learn. When leadership sees that buffer in your plans, pivots feel like good risk management rather than missed commitments.</p>

<p><strong>Create decision checkpoints tied to evidence, not dates.</strong> Instead of "ship feature X by Q2," commit to "validate assumption Y by end of Q1, then decide whether to proceed with feature X." This reframes the conversation from execution to learning.</p>

<p><strong>Distinguish between pivots and thrashing.</strong> Not every new piece of information warrants changing direction. Being wrong faster doesn't mean being reactive to every data point. It means synthesizing patterns from continuous discovery and making deliberate adjustments when you've discovered something significant.</p>

<p><strong>Celebrate validated learning, not just shipped features.</strong> When a team discovers they're wrong and pivots before wasting resources, that should be a win worth recognizing. If your org only celebrates launches, you're incentivizing people to ship the wrong thing confidently rather than adjust course strategically.</p>

<h2>When Certainty Is Dangerous</h2>

<p>I've learned to be suspicious of my own confidence. The times I've been most certain about a product direction are often the times I've been most disconnected from what customers actually need.</p>

<p>Certainty is seductive because it simplifies decision-making. When you're certain, you don't need to maintain multiple hypotheses. You don't need to build in flexibility. You don't need to keep listening for signals that you might be wrong. You just execute.</p>

<p>But certainty also makes you blind. When you're convinced you're right, you stop looking for evidence that you're not. You interpret ambiguous signals in ways that confirm your existing beliefs. You dismiss contradictory feedback as outliers or misunderstandings.</p>

<p>This is why the best PMs I know maintain a healthy skepticism of their own ideas. Not because they lack conviction, but because they know that conviction without continuous validation is just a comfortable way to build the wrong thing.</p>

<p>The question isn't "am I confident in this plan?" The question is "what would I need to see to know this plan is wrong, and am I actively looking for that signal?"</p>

<h2>Building the Muscle</h2>

<p>Learning to be wrong faster is a skill, not just a mindset. Here's how to build that muscle:</p>

<p><strong>Start with explicit assumptions.</strong> For any major initiative, write down what needs to be true for this to succeed. Not just high-level hopes like "customers will want this," but specific, testable assumptions like "practice managers will schedule upgrades themselves if they have a 24-hour window to choose from."</p>

<p><strong>Define "what would prove me wrong."</strong> For each assumption, explicitly state what evidence would make you rethink your approach. This creates clear decision points and prevents you from rationalizing away contradictory data.</p>

<p><strong>Build tight feedback loops.</strong> The faster you can test assumptions, the faster you can adjust. Instead of waiting for quarterly research studies, create continuous touchpoints with customers. Build prototypes. Run small experiments. Get signal flowing regularly.</p>

<p><strong>Separate learning investments from shipping commitments.</strong> When you commit to shipping something by a date, you're stuck. But if you commit to validating an assumption by a date, you preserve optionality. If you learn your assumption was wrong, you can pivot before investing in the full build.</p>

<p><strong>Practice changing your mind publicly.</strong> Share when you've discovered you were wrong. Explain what you learned and why you're adjusting course. This normalizes pivoting based on evidence and makes it easier for others on your team to do the same.</p>

<p>The point isn't to never be confident. It's to calibrate your confidence to the evidence you have. When you're operating on assumptions, treat them as assumptions. When you've validated something, then you can commit with real conviction.</p>

<h2>The Takeaway</h2>

<p>The myth of product management is that great PMs have great instincts. They just know what to build.</p>

<p>The reality is that great PMs have great systems for learning quickly. They know what they don't know. They build feedback loops that expose wrong assumptions early. They optimize for speed of learning, not appearance of certainty.</p>

<p>Your job isn't to be right. Your job is to discover when you're wrong before it costs too much to fix.</p>

<p>Be wrong faster. It's the only way to end up right.</p>`;
